Data Mining Analysis on Human Activity Recognition using Smartwatch Gyroscope

Abstract

The efficacy of a smartwatch gyroscope sensor biometric data to be used in Human activity recognition was considered in this study. The related work around HAR has analysed, and the use-cases in various areas were introduced. SEMMA was used to conduct a data mining process on the WISDM dataset. Four levels of data mining approaches were applied to the dataset. Descriptive analysis and inferential analysis have shown that there are significant differences between activity sensor values. Two models were proposed using decision trees and random forest, which successfully classified the activities with about 74% accuracy. Moreover, a Neural network model was designed with three layers, but the model could not give any promising performance in classifying the activities.
